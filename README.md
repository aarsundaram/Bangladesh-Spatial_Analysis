# Bangladesh-Spatial_Analysis
Used QGIS to identify population affected by cyclone Sidr (inundated population), their distance to the nearest major city for aid (mean coords) and identification of potential hubs (server point locations) for setting up distribution centres. 
They were mapped in mymaps, google maps to identify road networks that did not involve ferries or weak bridges.
